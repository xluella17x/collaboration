# collaboration

Git is for version control. Types of git include: Git checkout, Git revert and Git reset.

Git checkout is used to discard the changes in the working repository.

Git reset is used when we want to unstage a file and bring our changes back to the working directory. Git reset can also be used to remove commits from the local repository.

Git revert is used to remove the commits from the remote repository.
