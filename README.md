# What we have learned about Git

## Git
Git acts as a timeline for your project. It is a key tool for version control.

The "Main" timeline is the production ready code. Code here should be ready to use and bug free. 

Off the main timeline, there should be a development timeline that all collaborators have their own branches off of in order to not make any accidental change to the main branch before the code is ready. 

Along the timeline, the git records the "commits" made - these are the changes to the project.

There are three states the git can be in:

- The Working Directory
- The Staging Area
- The Commit
